Project 5
Deadlock
Liora Wachsstock

Compilation and running the program:
make
./oss [-t sec] [-h] [-l filename]

-t with argument allows the user to set the time for how long the program will run for
-h prints a help message and terminates
-l with argument allows user to set the name of the logfile
**************************************************************************************
Files:
messenger.c, messenger.h: holds functions for passing messenges back and forth between oss and userproceses

rd_table.c, rd_table.h: holds functions for CRUD operations for resource descriptor table, as well as **deadlock avoidance and safety algorithm **

queue.c, queue.h: holds funcitons for CRUD operations for process scheduling queues

clock.c, clock.h: holds functions for CRUD operations (including shared memory and semaphore initializations) for clock functionality

userprocess.c: userprocess binary

oss.c, oss.h: main process scheduling simulator code

****************************************************************************
Communication to OSS is handled through message queues.
Deadlock resolving: terminate all process that have that requested resource except for the one that requested it

Outstanding Problems:
- sometimes the program gets stuck waiting for a message, but hitting ctrl-c works fine and deletes all shared memory and semaphores
